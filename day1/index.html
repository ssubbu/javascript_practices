<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p>In this example, x, y, and z are variables.</p>

// JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
// Before 2015, using the var keyword was the only way to declare a JavaScript variable. 
// All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
// These unique names are called identifiers.
// Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

/* The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

    - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    - Names must begin with a letter
    - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
    - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
    - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

  JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The value of z is: " + z;



/* 

 * The 2015 version of JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015) allows the use of the const keyword to define a variable that cannot  be reassigned, and the let keyword to define a variable with restricted scope.

 * These two keywords provide Block Scope variables (and constants) in JavaScript.

 * Before ES2015, JavaScript had only two types of scope: Global Scope and Function Scope. 

 * Before ES2015 JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

// Example of Global Scope 
// Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
// Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. 


var empName = 'riche';

// code here can use empName
console.log("Employee Name is "+empName);

function myFunction() {
  // code here can also use empName
  console.log("Employee Name is "+empName);
}

function myFunction() {
  // code here can also use empName
  console.log("Employee Name is "+empName);
}

// Example of Function Scope
// Variables declared Locally (inside a function) have Function Scope.
// Local variables can only be accessed from inside the function where they are declared. 

// code here can NOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  var empName = "Volvo";
  // code here CAN use empName
  console.log("Employee Name is "+empName);
}

// code here can NOT use empName 
console.log("Employee Name is "+empName);


// Example of Block Scope
// Variables declared with the var keyword cannot have Block Scope.
// Variables declared inside a block {} can be accessed from outside the block. 


{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here 
console.log("The x value is "+x);


//Redeclaring Variables
//Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.
//Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:

 var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{
  var x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 2 

// Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.
// Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:


 var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{
  let x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 10
